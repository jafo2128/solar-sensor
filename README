  Solar sensor program that implements the following:

   - read temperature, humidity and geiger counter sensors
   - read and set alarms in the real time clock
   - log sensor data on an OpenLog module
   - use a communication protocol to send data to a PC

  there are 3 components in this repository:
  avr       - contains the Arduino code for the microcontroller
  hardware  - open source hardware for the main board
  server    - server-side implementation of the comm protocol


  Library dependencies for the avr:

  ds3231      https://github.com/rodan/ds3231
  IRremote    http://www.arcfn.com/2009/08/multi-protocol-infrared-remote-library.html
  Sensirion   http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Code/Sensirion


  dependencies for the server-side software:

  linux with working ftdi kernel driver
  sqlite      http://www.sqlite.org/
  gnuplot     http://www.gnuplot.info/

  Lithium Ion polymer Battery - 2Ah 3.7V  - seeed studio sku: POW103C1P
  XBee 2mW Chip Antenna - Series 2 ZigBee (2 pcs)  - sparkfun sku: WRL-10415
  XBee Explorer USB  - sparkfun sku: WRL-08687
  main board that includes the LiPo charger, DS3231 with a solid state relay to 
    wake up the system, 5v boost, logic level converter, 3.3v stabilized source
    available from https://github.com/rodan/solar-sensor/tree/master/hardware


  How does it work

    Power: the main power is from a 2Ah LiPo cell that is charged from the solar panel. a stabilization circuit and a boost give out 3.3V and 5V respectively. a small coin cell battery keeps the DS3231 RTC chip working at all times. the RTC's alarm function is waking up the microcontroller and the sensors via a solid state relay once every 30 minutes.

    Sensors: some are internal and some kept outside. The outside temperature and humidity are measured by a SHT15 chip. the Geiger-Muller tube is also kept outside. the internal temperature is read from the RTC chip.

    Sensor data: is saved to a uSD card (on an OpenLog module) and if the receiving PC is up and if the wireless signal haven't got too much interference than a protocol is used to send new data to the PC. in the end it is being rendered here: http://www.simplex.ro/ro/statie_meteo.html

    Commands: are being given either via the wireless serial interface or via a universal remote control that can speak RC5 (most remotes can).
